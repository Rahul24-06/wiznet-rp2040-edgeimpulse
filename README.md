## Why Did We Build This? & The Solution

Prevention is better than cure" is one of the effective measures to prevent the spreading of COVID-19 and to protect mankind. Many researchers and doctors are The maintenance of the ambiance in places such as laboratories, especially chemical labs is essential. The temperature and humidity have to be monitored continuously and the level of air quality and heat levels are used as an interrupt to prevent laboratory accidents. The data from the sensors are fed to an ML algorithm to identify an anomaly and inform the security team via email.

Now the connection are done. We will be using the internal temperature sensor from the Raspberry Pi Pico for data collection. 

## IDE setup 

  The next step is to add the Raspberry Pi Pico to the Arduino IDE. This is done by the following steps. First, copy the following text
  " https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico/releases/download/global/package_rp2040_index.json " and paste it to the File->Preferences and click OK.

  Once done, go to Tools -> Boards -> Boards Manager and type "pico" in the search box. Install the Raspberry Pi Pico / RP 2040 board to the IDE.

Now the board is installed to the Arduino IDE.

## TinyML on Raspberry Pi Pico 
The main idea of this project is to use Raspberry Pi pico to detect some anomaly on the temperature data and the entire classification is done on the RP2040 MCU. 

Depending on the hardware capacity and memory size, different types of MCU/Application can be used in the TinyML, as shown in the bellow chart.

To run a machine learning model on the Raspberry Pi pico, we need the ambient temperature data. Since the Raspberry Pi Pico has internal temperature sensor, we use them to collect the temperature data. The ARM Cortex M0+ is suitable for the Anomaly Detection and Sensor Classification which allows us to implement this project. 

**Data Collection from Sensor**
The First step is to collect the temperature data from the internal temperature sensor. Data is loaded using the built-in CLI which reads the sensor data from Pico's serail port. We can also import the data in the form of CSV or JSON file format. 

Arduino Code to read internal temperature and send data via serial port
```
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  delay(5000);
}

void loop() {
  Serial.println(analogReadTemp());
  delay(1000);
}
```

## Working of the Project ðŸ”­

To test the real-time scenario, we deployed it on one of the rooms to test how possibly it could be used and the results were pretty affirmative.
